Depending on the number of worker nodes of the cluster, you need to rename the worker node name to r07 or r08 or r09 or r10. In this repo, I have single worker node in the cluster , so all the deployment file you can find one worker node called r07.
Service files are updated with different ports, starts from 27017 to 27023.
Update the service name in  mongodb-reservation-service.yaml and mongodb-reservation-deployment.yaml with mongodb-reserve.
